    <!-- The Story -->
    <section class="intro">
      <h2>Built By Streamers, For Streamers</h2>
      <p>Stream Slugger was born from a simple question: "How can we make livestreaming more interactive and fun for everyone involved?" As streamers ourselves, we experienced firsthand the challenge of keeping audiences engaged during long streams. We wanted to create something that would turn viewers into active participants, not just passive observers.</p>

      <p>After months of development and testing with real streamers and their communities, Stream Slugger emerged as a powerful tool that brings gaming, interactivity, and community together in ways never before possible on Twitch.</p>
